# Hello friends!

Hello friends! Whether you've stumbled upon this by way of *internet-magic* or have been *directed here intentionally*, I'd like to: 1st, welcome you[^1] and 2nd, give you some background information and some general disclaimers that I felt were necessary but didn't know where to put.

So...

**DISCLAIMER:** I AM **NOT** AN EXPERT.[^2]

## What exactly is this?

This is a collection of articles and explainers for different **coding-related** concepts and hardware for the [:FIRST Tech Challenges](#WhatIsTheFIRSTTechChallenge). All guides are written primarily for **Java**.

But... maybe let's start with what this isn't... 
- This is NOT the be-all and end-all of guides or educational content for FIRST. 
- This is NOT the most comprehensive explanation of how things work. 
- This is certainly NOT a step-by-step tutorial on how to build the best robot.[^3]

This is a jumping off point! A way I wish I had to introduce myself to concepts and components used in code. 


Finally, as you've probably noticed these explainers use a few helpful tools: 

We use [:nutshells](#Nutshell)! <-- Click on this to open

And we use little feetnotes[^4]. <-- Hover over the square! *Powered by [littlefoot.js](https://littlefoot.js.org/)*

## Why should we trust *you*?

As I've said before, I am no expert, so maybe you shouldn't trust me? But I *have* been competing as part of my high school's FTC team[^5] for the past two years and over that time I have built a knowledge and understanding I would deem as: *proficient*

Browse the [articles](/first/articles) and see if my explanations are something you might like, it won't hurt!

**Good luck!**



[^1]: Welcome!
[^2]: Everything compiled in these articles has been developed by my own experience coding for the FIRST Tech Challenge. There are plenty of *much* more comprehensive resources out there (some of which I'll show you). These are simply some tips I wish I had when I began learning!
[^3]: That one is on you!

# :x Nutshell
Woah! An expandable textbox! Perfect to describe things in detail or go off on tangents.
